    "When using Matplotlib in this form in a Jupyter notebook, it is very important to bear in mind that almost all errors generated by functions that the interactive interface call are masked/hidden, i.e. they will interupt the execution of the calling function concerned, but no error message will be visible. This can make debugging extremely difficult! It is thus crucial to find a way to avoid this during development. One possibility to achieve this is to \"layer\" the development, i.e. to explicitly call the step() and draw() function from the command line (Jupyter cell) first without using the interactive interface at all (This will leave error messages visible). Only in the final step, when the update functions work, should the interactive interface be wrapped around everything.  "
